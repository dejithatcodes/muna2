    <p><h2>Come closer, It has been rocky for us these past couple of years, filled with hurt and happiness. Meeting felt like a light shining in my life, swallowing the darkness I felt within most of the time, and these past few years we have been off and on, has been a trial period of me trying to be a better person, learning how to love you better and make you happy. I want to be the person you think of when you want to feel happy or peace. Learning to love you has been an amazing adventure cause you made it so. And now it has gotten to the point where things that are precious to be the most and things that make you happy, not only your love or smile but also everything about you is priceless to me, I will be by your side always, just don’t slither away from me, save all your hugs and kisses for me, we have had a long wait with lots of hiccups and much longing over and over and I think these can’t be in vain, cause for some odd reason we always come back to each other . I do not think there are enough words to tell you how much you mean to me , sometimes I sit quietly and think about all the little things you do that warms my heart and make me happy, the funny thing is you do not realize you do them..lol, how you look at me when we talk like I am the only person that exists in your world, you have seen me at my worst and best and yet you still love me unconditionally which is something lol, that kind of love is special and I cherish more than words can express. Recently you have inspired me to be a better version of myself in my thoughts and actions, and when I think differently about certain situations you give me a fresh perspective and suggesting better without undermining mine, your kindness and strength remind me that there is beauty in vulnerability and power in love. You are not just my boyfriend, you are my best friend and my greatest support, I promise to always cherish and respect the bond we share. Thank you for being you; for every laugh, thoughts , every late night conversation. I love you more than words can say and I am so grateful for every moment we share.
